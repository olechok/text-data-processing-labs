# Task for lab 5

Use a naive Bayesian classifier.
Create a program that:
1. Reads a given data set, performs preprocessing (tokenization,
removal of stop words, lemmatization, etc.) using the spaCy library.

2. Splits the data into training and test data. Performs sentiment analysis using classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression,
support vectors, etc.). Outputs a discrepancy matrix and model accuracy.

3. Uses one of the ready-made lexicons, such as Textblob, to
analyze sentiment assessment. Also calculates a discrepancy matrix and
model accuracy.

4. Selects three random entries and outputs the results of their sentiment assessment according to points 2) and 3).

# Task for labs 6, 7 and 8

### Lab 6:
1. Create several examples in json format on the topic of the variant
(in English or Ukrainian) for recognizing a new type of
entities (choose yourself).
Create a program that adds these examples to the existing spaCy model, trains the model.
Demonstrate the work.

2. Apply the TextCategorizer component to determine intentions. Choose the data for training on the topic of the variant yourself or use the specified file (utterance contains an utterance, intent - intention). These
files contain examples of user dialogues with the assistant system on a specific topic, for example, ordering tickets, etc. Train
the component and demonstrate work.

### Lab 7:

Topic: flights. File flights.json.
1. Highlight departure points using the Matcher class.
Highlight the user's utterances where he asks to change something
(for example, Find me something else.), using templates. Use the flights.json file.

2. Apply syntactic dependencies to determine intents.

Use the file from Lab 6 (not necessarily all the statements).

### Lab 8:

Create a program that configures pre-trained converters and
uses them to generate dialogues on the topic of the variant. As
training data, you can use the sets from Lab 6.
Demonstrate the work.
